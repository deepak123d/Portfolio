                    <ol>
                        <li><span>Text and Typography:</span> Ensure that text is large enough to read comfortably. Use scalable units (like em or rem) rather than fixed units (px). Use easily readable fonts. Avoid overly decorative fonts for body text.</li>
                        <li><span>Navigation:</span> Ensure that all interactive elements (links, buttons, forms) are accessible via keyboard. Users should be able to navigate through the site using the Tab key.</li>
                        <li><span>Forms and Input Fields:</span> Ensure all form fields have clear labels and instructions. Use the <label> element and associate it correctly with the input fields.</li>
                        <li><span>Color and Design:</span>Avoid using color alone to convey information. Use patterns, textures, or text labels in addition to color.</li>
