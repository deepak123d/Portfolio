                <span>Impact:</span> The new Ghalley Restaurant website will enhance online presence, improve customer convenience with detailed menus and easy reservations, and increase orders. It will attract new customers, boost satisfaction and loyalty, and strengthen the restaurant's brand image, driving business growth.
            </p>
            <p class="speech-bubble left">
                <span>What was learned:</span> Throughout the design process for the Ghalley Restaurant website, I gained valuable insights into the importance of prioritizing user needs and preferences. By conducting thorough user research, including surveys, interviews, and competitor analysis, I learned to identify pain points and design solutions that address them effectively. Understanding the significance of detailed menu information, convenient online booking systems, and a seamless mobile experience has highlighted the key areas where the website can make the most impact on enhancing the overall user experience.
            </p>
            <p class="speech-bubble right">
                <span>Next steps:</span> Moving forward, the next steps for the Ghalley Restaurant website project involve several key actions. Firstly, prototype testing will be conducted to gather feedback and refine the design before launch. Following this, content creation will focus on developing engaging and informative text and visuals to enrich the website's storytelling. Technical development will then commence to implement the design using a suitable technology stack. Finally, the website will be launched and promoted to drive traffic, with continuous improvement based on user feedback and analytics ensuring that the platform evolves to meet the changing needs of its audience over time.
